# Introduction
This repository is a collection of training exercises for the Algorithm-Analysis class, containing search algorithms,, graph algorithms, dynamic algorithms and others.

# How to run
Since all the exercises were made in C++, to test the exercises, you can simply run the c++ scripts by:
- gcc (or g++) file.cpp && ./a.out or ./a.exe (depending on platform)
